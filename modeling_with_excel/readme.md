The idea here is to show how Risk Modeling can be done quickly using excel as well. 
Business is often short on time and infrastructure when doing Risk Modeling for a new use-case. At
those times, when the dataset is reasonable sized(reducing the dependency on BigData Stack), this could
be a way to go. My goal is always to figure out quick ways to solve a problem minimizing Business Risk. 

Will add a step by step guide how to use OpenSolver plugin to help with Model Building.
